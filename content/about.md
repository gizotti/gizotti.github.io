I am Gabriel but you can call me Gabe.

I am a Developer with over 10 years experience, the majority of it on web applications, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails.

Throughout my career I worked in companies of difference sizes, spamming different industries such as international education services, digital asset distribution, and healthcare.

I am a sucker for boring technology, striving to solve complex problems with the simpler solution possible and battle tested tools.
